                                                          <p>On 30 September at 9:59 p.m. local time, a magnitude 6.9 earthquake with a shallow depth of 5 kilometers struck off the coast of Bogo City, Cebu province. The tremor prompted the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (PHIVOLCS) to issue a tsunami alert, which was lifted in the early hours of 01 October. PHIVOLCS has since recorded 349 aftershocks ranging from magnitude 1.4 to 4.8, which are expected to continue in the coming days.</p>
<p>There are 56 reported deaths and 201 injuries, mostly in Bogo City, Medellin, and San Remigio as per Cebu Provincial Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (PDRRMC), 12:00 noon report. Figures are still subject to verification by the national government and are expected to rise as more reports are received. According to the DSWD DROMIC report as of 6:00 PM on October 1, over 111,600 individuals have been affected, with more than 20,000 displaced, mostly are staying outside evacuation centers. Based on the 2024 census, the four most affected municipalities and cities (Bogo, Daanbantayan, Medellin, San Remigio) have a combined population of over 315,000 people.</p>
<p>Initial reports indicate widespread damage to homes, churches, public buildings, roads, and ports. Many displaced families are sheltering in front of their houses and in open spaces due to the ongoing aftershocks. (<a href=""https://reliefweb.int/node/4178847"">OCHA, 1 Oct 2025</a>)</p>

                                                          <p>The newly formed tropical cyclone BUALOI - named Opong in the Philippines - is moving northwest toward central Philippines. On 25 September at 0.00 UTC, its centre was located 383 km east of Samar Island’s eastern coast, with maximum sustained winds of 102 km/h (tropical storm). BUALOI is expected to continue northwest and may make landfall over southern Luzon Island between 25 and 26 September. It will subsequently cross central and northern Philippines - particularly southern Luzon and Mindoro - from 26 to 27 September, bringing heavy rain and strong winds. After that, it will continue north-west over the South China sea and it could make landfall over north-eastern Viet Nam on 29-30 September. (<a href=""https://reliefweb.int/node/4177835"">ECHO, 25 Sep 2025</a>)</p>
<p>Tropical cyclone BUALOI (named ""Opong"" in the Philippines) made landfall over the eastern Samar Island, central Visayas, central Philippines on late in the afternoon (UTC) of 25 September with maximum sustained winds of 102 km/h (tropical storm). On 26 September at 0.00 UTC its centre was located over the western Masbate island, central Visayas, with maximum sustained winds of 111 km/h (tropical storm). The passage of BUALOI over central Philippines caused very heavy rainfall, strong winds, floods and landslides. NDRRMC reports, as of 26 September, 14 fatalities, two missing, 17 injured, more than 50,300 displaced people and a total of approximately 1.21 million affected people. BUALOI is expected to pass over western Visayas on 26 September, slightly strengthening, with maximum sustained winds up to 120 km/h (typhoon). After that, it is forecast to continue north-west over the South China Sea and to make landfall over northern Viet Nam on 28 September with maximum sustained winds up to 148 km/h. (<a href=""https://reliefweb.int/node/4178051"">ECHO, 26 Sep 2025</a>)</p>
<p>Tropical cyclone BUALOI made its second landfall in central-northern Viet Nam over the area of Ky Anh town (Ha Tinh province) on 28 September around 18.00 UTC, with maximum sustained winds up to 155 km/h (typhoon). On 29 September at 6.00 UTC, its centre was located approximately over the border area between northern Viet Nam and north-eastern Laos, with maximum sustained winds of 93 km/h (tropical storm). BUALOI's passage over the Philippines, combined with previous tropical cyclones and the ongoing Southwest monsoon, caused very heavy rainfall, floods and landslides, resulting in 27 fatalities, 16 missing, 33 injured, around 190,800 displaced and approximately 3.42 million affected people. In Thailand, seven fatalities, around 100,000 displaced and nearly 270,000 affected people were reported. In Viet Nam, nine fatalities, an uncertain number of displaced people and over 30 isolated villages were reported, mainly due to landslides. BUALOI is expected to continue moving north-west over northern Laos on 29 September, further weakening and dissipating over eastern Myanmar on 30 September. (<a href=""https://reliefweb.int/node/4178282"">ECHO, 29 Sep 2025</a>)</p>
<p>On 30 September, very early in the morning (UTC), tropical depression BUALOI dissipated over the border area between north-western Laos and eastern Myanmar. Its passage over the Philippines (combined with the previous tropical cyclones and the ongoing Southwest monsoon) caused very heavy rainfall, floods and landslides. The NDRRMC reports, as of 1 October, 37 fatalities, 14 still missing persons and 41 injured people. In addition, around 122,900 currently displaced people (of whom 81,750 are across 1,123 evacuation centres) and approximately 4.12 million affected people were reported. In Laos, the ADINet reports, as of the same date, two fatalities and a total of over 10,100 affected people. In Viet Nam, the same source reports 26 fatalities, 22 still missing people, 105 injured people, and nearly 598,700 affected people. In Thailand, the IFRC reports eight fatalities and more than 293,600 affected people. (<a href=""https://reliefweb.int/node/4178794"">ECHO, 1 Oct 2025</a>)</p>
<p>As of 1 October, authorities reported 36 deaths, 21 people missing and 147 injured after severe flooding, landslides and wind damage across northern and north- central Viet Nam. Many homes, healthcare facilities and schools have been affected. Around 154,807 homes are damaged or roofless and about 57,915 are flooded. Power and road networks remain disrupted (about 6,406 power poles down; around 1,400 road blockages), with around 1,500 households isolated in Hà Tĩnh. About 51.269 ha of crops and around 13,478 ha of aquaculture are affected, creating short-term food access risks in cut-off communes.

The epicenter was located in Kama district, some 30 km northeast of the city of Jalalabad. Several aftershocks have occurred since, with the initial quake felt in neighbouring provinces including Kunar, Laghman and Nuristan, as well as Kabul. The quake’s hypocenter was estimated at only 8 to 10 km beneath the surface, exacerbating the quake’s impact. Preliminary reports indicate that at least 800 people have been killed across four provinces – Kunar, Laghman, Nangarhar and Nuristan – with a further estimated 2,000 people injured, many of them residing in deeply remote and mountainous areas with key access routes blocked by rocks and landslides. Initial figures indicate up to 12,000 people are directly affected, with Chawkay and Nurgal districts in Kunar Province and Dara-e-Nur district in Nangarhar Province the most impacted. In addition, Chapa Dara, Dara-e-Pech and Watapur districts in Kunar Province; Alingar, Mehtarlam and Qarghayi districts in Laghman Province; and Jalalabad city, Behsud and Kuz Kunar districts in Nangarhar Province have also sustained loss of life and severe damage.

<p>The humanitarian impact of the 6.0 M earthquake that struck north-eastern Afghanistan on 31 August at 19:17 UTC (23:47 local time) continues to grow. The epicentre was located approximately 27 km northeast of Jalalabad City in Nangarhar Province. According to UN OCHA and IOM, as of 3 September, 1,457 people have died, 3,394 have been injured, and 6,782 houses have been destroyed. The most severely affected districts include Nurgal and Chawkay (Kunar Province), Dara-e-Nur (Nangarhar Province), and parts of Laghman Province. Furthermore, approximately 497,000 people are affected, of whom 263,000 are children. Humanitarian partners and de facto authorities are conducting response efforts. Access remains challenging due to the mountainous terrain, blocked roads, landslides, and limited communication infrastructure. (<a href=""https://reliefweb.int/node/4173883"">ECHO, 4 Sep 2025</a>)</p>
<p>Initial reports from joint field assessments completed in 25 villages across five districts (Chapa Dara, Chawkay, Dara-e-Pech, Nurgal and Watapur) in Kunar Province, two districts (Dara-e-Nur and Kuz Kunar) in Nangarhar Province and one district (Alingar) in Laghman Province indicate that 2,924 families (17,051 people) have been affected with 1,368 people killed (373 women, 299 men, 374 girls and 322 boys), a further 2,180 injured (1,212 females and 968 males) and 2,924 homes destroyed (2,627) and damaged (297) in these areas alone. Numbers are expected to continue to rise as assessment data is received; a further 22 assessment teams were deployed today.

<p>A new strong earthquake of 5.6 M at a depth of 10 km occurred in the Kunar province, north-eastern Afghanistan on 4 September at 16:56 UTC (21:26 local time). The epicentre was located very close - approximately 1 km south - to the 6.0 M earthquake that occurred around 27 km north-east of Jalalabad city, Nangarhar province on 31 August at 19:17 UTC. For this new event - part of the seismic sequence which started on 31 August - USGS PAGER estimates that up to 85,000 people were exposed to strong shaking and 411,000 to moderate shaking. Aftershocks continue. (<a href=""https://reliefweb.int/node/4174144"">ECHO, 5 Sep 2025</a>)</p>
<p>As of 8 September, repeated quakes have further displaced 783 families to Shalt and Zere Baba area of Nurgal district, where women, girls, and children face increased protection risks due to unsafe conditions and limited services. Nurgal and Chawkay districts in Kunar, Dara-e-Nur in Nangarhar province, and parts of Laghman province were hit hardest, further compounded by another strong quake on 4 September. Damaged mountain roads severely limit access, making air transport the only reliable option. A joint IOM, WFP, and OCHA field observations on 6 September 2025 to Nurgal district confirmed widespread destruction, rising community tensions, damaged irrigation systems, and heightened flood risk, underscoring the urgent need for scaled up support.

<p>The reported number of people killed and injured has risen further, with 2,164 people confirmed killed, and a further 3,428 injured. Numbers are expected to continue to rise as assessments continue across in four villages. As of 8 September, an estimated 2,620 earthquake-affected families have arrived in three informal settlements that have been formed in Patan (1,000) and Zirai Baba (720) villages in Nurgal District and Khas Kunar District (900).

<p>As of 15 September, of the 8,489 families assessed thus far, 7,716 families (90 per cent) are currently sheltering in open space, exposed to the elements and the cold. The damage to water and sanitation infrastructure is extensive with more than 130 water sources reported damaged and destroyed across the 134 assessed villages. Due to the damage to water and sanitation infrastructure, 112 communities are currently practicing open defecation, 104 communities have no hand washing station available and 107 communities report a lack of hygiene-related NFIs such as soap. Considering that cholera is already endemic in the region, a rise in the number of cases already observed pre-quake since mid-July and with severe shortages of essential hygiene and sanitation NFIs recorded in the affected areas, humanitarian partners remain concerned for a wide-spread outbreak of Cholera and other waterborne diseases. Across the affected areas, 90 community-based education (CBE) classes and 24 public schools in Nangarhar (10) and Kunar (14) provinces were damaged or destroyed by the earthquake, affecting the education of 2,434 children.

<p>Humanitarian response is ongoing following the 6+ magnitude earthquake that struck the eastern region of Afghanistan on 31 August, and significant aftershocks on 2, 4 and 23 September. Multi-sector needs assessments have now been completed in 134 of the 411 hardest-hit villages – that is, those that experienced levels 7 and 8 shaking on the Modified Mercalli Scale (MMI). Needs assessments have verified 8,471 families in the assessed villages were directly impacted by the earthquake (almost 56,000 people), with 1,992 people killed (52 per cent women and girls), 3,631 people injured (54 per cent women and girls) and 8,471 homes destroyed or damaged. Over 3,000 families currently reside in at least five major sites for internally displaced people (IDP) across two districts, with many smaller areas of displacement across the entire earthquake affected area. While several of the IDP sites are along the Kunar River basin and relatively accessible, several are in mountain valleys with limited access. With some 94 per cent of families living in open space/makeshift shelters with temperatures dropping as winter approaches, there is a critical need for winterization and shelter support in high-altitude areas to prevent further displacement. Additionally, the earthquake killed more than 7,000 livestock with 96 per cent of affected households have lost food sources.

It provides an update on the EUAA’s previous report of May 2024, including in terms of the security situation, and reviews the latest developments regarding the treatment of select profiles by State and non-State actors.</p>
<p>Over the last year, and despite a continued decline in attacks, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (<strong>ISIL</strong>) has <strong>remained active in several governorates</strong> (Anbar, Baghdad, Diyala, Kirkuk, Ninewa, Salah Al-Din), primarily <strong>targeting security forces</strong> through asymmetric operations. <strong>Türkiye continued its military campaign against the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK)</strong> in the north of the country, by carrying out air and drone strikes, as well as ground operations. Following the PKK’s unilateral ceasefire and announcement of dissolution in May 2025, Turkish strikes peaked in June (notably in Duhok’s Amedi district) before sharply decreasing in July, although new ground operations were launched in Zakho’s Batifa district.</p>
<p><strong>Tribal violence remained a security concern especially in southern Iraq</strong>, while family disputes requently turned violent in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq (KRI). Iran-backed militias were widely suspected in strikes against oil fields in the region. Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) faced <strong>major challenges in accessing housing, basic services and documentation</strong>, limiting opportunities in education and healthcare. Many IDPs remained unwilling to return due to insecurity and insufficient reconstruction.</p>
<p><strong>The report highlights persistent human rights concerns</strong>, including lack of accountability for serious crimes, ongoing discrimination and harassment of women, children, LGBTIQ+ individuals, and civil society actors. Individuals with perceived ISIL affiliation – including children – <strong>continued to face prosecution, detention and difficulties accessing civil documentation</strong>. Reports of torture, ill-treatment, and enforced disappearances persisted. A recent amendment to the Personal Status Law granted Shia religious authorities expanded control over family matters, <strong>raising concerns about child marriage, polygamy and restrictions on women’s rights.</strong></p>
